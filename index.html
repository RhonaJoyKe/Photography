                    Buffalo live mostly on the plains, but some are known to inhabit river valleys as well as forests. Plains Indians used every part of the buffalo to help them survive. Their hides were used for clothing, blankets and shelters, meat was used for food, and bones were used for tools and toys. Horns were used for cups and spoons while tendons were used for thread and bowstrings. Buffalo chips were used for fuel.

                    There are five species of Rhinos.THey have poor vision.Two African – black and white rhinos – and three Asian – greater one-horned, Sumatran and Javan rhinos. Three of these (black, Sumatran and Javan) are listed as ‘critically endangered’ by IUCN – there are thought to be fewer than 70 Javan and 100 Sumatran rhinos left in the wild, meaning their populations are truly under threat of extinction.
